# Homestead / editor
The `editor` package provides a range of functions for communicating with VS Code and potentially other text editors/IDEs in the future.

## Uses
- Generating VS Code URI to connect to Homestead container
- Writing container specific config that VS Code can read (auto install extensions and so on)
